## Project Name
Mic'd Up

## Overview
I would like to develop an application that allows users create, track, sign-up for, and manage events and open-mics within the stand up comedy community. The primary user of the application will be mic/show hosts and the secondary users are the comedians signing up to be on them. As a host you will be able to create an event and add all the pertinent details to it. If possible I'd like to make it so other users could sign up for this event through the application via email. Solve capacity issues before everyone gets to the door. As a secondary user you will be able to track, follow, and ideally sign up for events that are found in the application. 
## Personal Motivation
I want to make this application because I have been a stand up comedian in the scene for over five years and have yet to see one centralized repository of consistent information events and shows that is both user friendly and efficient. I believe adding the reward/entertainment factor to the application will increase both attendance to events but also increase the user base.
